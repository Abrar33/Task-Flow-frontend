# Team Board Frontend (frontend)

This is the client-side application for the Team Board collaborative task management platform. It provides a real-time, drag-and-drop interface for managing boards, lists, and tasks.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Single-Page Application (SPA):** Built with React and React Router.
* **Drag & Drop (DnD):** Uses `react-dnd` to allow users to easily move tasks between lists.
* **Real-time Updates:** Utilizes **Socket.IO** to instantly sync board, task, and notification changes across all active users.
* **Context API for State Management:** Dedicated contexts for **Auth**, **Boards**, and **Notifications** to manage global state.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration.
* **Board & Task CRUD:** Full functionality for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting boards, lists, and tasks.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** UI controls and actions (like adding/deleting lists/tasks, inviting members) are restricted to **Admin** and **Member** roles.
* **Toast Notifications:** Uses `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Framework:** React
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **State Management:** React Context API + Hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, etc.)
* **Real-time:** Socket.IO Client
* **Drag & Drop:** `react-dnd` with `HTML5Backend`
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (*inferred from utility classes like `dark:bg-gray-900`, `flex-shrink-0`*)
* **Icons:** `react-icons`
